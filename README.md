# MRFs for Edge Detection

## Description
This project demonstrates the application of **Markov Random Fields (MRFs)** in edge detection within images.  
MRFs are powerful models used to capture dependencies among variables, making them ideal for detecting boundaries and transitions in image data.  

The project includes:  
- A theoretical explanation of MRFs and their core properties.  
- A comparison between Markov processes and MRFs.  
- An implementation of MRF-based edge detection on example images.  

## Features
- Explanation of Markov Random Fields (MRFs).  
- Comparison with Markov processes.  
- Application of MRFs in edge detection.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  

## Installation
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MRFs-Edge-Detection.git
cd MRFs-Edge-Detection
